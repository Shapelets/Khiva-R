\usage{
LjungBox(tss, lags)
}
\arguments{
\item{tss}{Expects an input array whose dimension zero is the length of the time series (all the same) and dimension
one indicates the number of time series.}

\item{lags}{Number of lags being tested.}
}
\value{
Array containing the Ljung-Box statistic test.
}
\description{
The Ljungâ€“Box test checks that data whithin the time series are independently distributed (i.e. the correlations in
the population from which the sample is taken are 0, so that any observed correlations in the data result from
randomness of the sampling process). Data are no independently distributed, if they exhibit serial correlation.
The test statistic is:
\deqn{
   Q = n\left(n+2\right)\sum_{k=1}^h\frac{\hat{\rho}^2_k}{n-k}
}
where ''n'' is the sample size, \eqn{\hat{\rho}k } is the sample autocorrelation at lag ''k'', and ''h'' is the
number of lags being tested. Under \eqn{H_0} the statistic Q follows a \eqn{\chi^2{(h)}}. For significance level
\eqn{\alpha}, the \eqn{critical region} for rejection of the hypothesis of randomness is:
\deqn{
  Q > \chi_{1-\alpha,h}^2
}
where \eqn{\chi_{1-\alpha,h}^2} is the \eqn{\alpha} -quantile of the chi-squared distribution with ''h'' degrees of
freedom.
