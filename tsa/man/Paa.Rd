\description{
Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) approximates a time series \eqn{X} of length \eqn{n} into vector
\eqn{\bar{X}=(\bar{x}_{1},â€¦,\bar{x}_{M})} of any arbitrary length \eqn{M \leq n} where each of \eqn{\bar{x_{i}}} is
calculated as follows:
\deqn{
\bar{x}_{i} = \frac{M}{n} \sum_{j=n/M(i-1)+1}^{(n/M)i} x_{j}.
}
