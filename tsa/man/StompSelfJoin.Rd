\usage{
StompSelfJoin(t, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{TSA Array the time series.}

\item{m}{TSA Array the time series.}
}
\value{
List of TSA Arrays with the matrix profile and the index profile
}
\description{
STOMP algorithm to calculate the matrix profile between 't' and itself using a subsequence length
of 'm'. This method filters the trivial matches.
