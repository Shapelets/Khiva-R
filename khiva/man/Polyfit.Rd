Polyfit(x, y, deg)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{KHIVA array with the x-coordinates of the M sample points \eqn{(x[i], y[i])}.}

\item{y}{KHIVA array with the y-coordinates of the sample points.}

\item{deg}{Degree of the fitting polynomial}
}
\value{
: KHIVA array with the polynomial coefficients, highest power first.
}
\description{
Least squares polynomial fit. Fit a polynomial \eqn{p(x) = p[0] * x^{deg} + ... + p[deg]} of degree
\eqn{deg} to points \eqn{(x, y)}. Returns a vector of coefficients \eqn{p} that minimises the squared error.
